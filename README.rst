TED player
==========

TED player is an app for Librarian_, Outernet's library management server.

TED player is written using HTML5 and JavaScript, and Librarian's experimental
files API to construct a playlist of TED_ videos and play them in the browser.

This app is still under development, and it serves as both a test case and
example of using Librarian for application development.
